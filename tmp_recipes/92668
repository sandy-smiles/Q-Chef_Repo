    "For the hot hot roots, heat the oil in a casserole over a medium heat and add the onions. Fry for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown, stirring well to ensure they don't burn. Add the garlic, ginger and chilli and cook for a further 5-6 minutes, stirring regularly, then add the spices and cook for a further minute, or until fragrant.",
    "Stir in the carrots, parsnips, sweet potatoes and potatoes and continue to cook for 4-5 minutes, or until softened and golden-brown. Add the vegetable stock (or water), bay leaves, tomato purée, soft dark brown sugar and crushed cashew nuts and stir to combine. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
    "Bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender, adding extra stock if the mixture becomes too dry. (The sauce should be thick enough to just coat the vegetables.)",
    "Add the beans and spinach, cook for a further three minutes, or until the beans are just tender, then stir in the cream. Add half the lime juice and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more lime juice, to taste, as necessary",
    "Meanwhile, for the mango and coconut relish, transfer the soaked coconut to a food processor (squeeze the coconut to remove any excess water). Add the mustard seeds, caster sugar, rum and salt and blend to a coarse paste.",
    "Layer the mango slices with spoonfuls of the coconut paste onto a serving plate, squeezing over the lime juice and a sprinkle of chilli between each layer. Sprinkle the mint over the top of the relish. (If you're preparing the relish ahead of time, add the mint just before serving.)",
    "Serve the hot hot roots scattered with chopped cashew nuts, and spoon the relish alongside."
