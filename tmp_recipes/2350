    "Squeeze the juice of the passion fruit, seeds and all, limes and orange into a bowl. Scrape in the seeds of one vanilla pod and mix well.",
    "Cut the sea bass into thin slivers and arrange neatly on a large plate. Pour over the juice, almost submerging the fish. Scatter over slices of red and yellow chillies and cover the plate with a piece of kitchen film. The sea bass is actually going to be 'cooked' by the acidity in the dressing so leave in the fridge for at least an hour or even overnight.",
    "When you are ready to serve, add some finely chopped chives and pick some coriander leaves over to top to finish."
